=head2 DESCRIPTION

Attach a disk to the provisioned VM, or fusemount something as the application's user.

This is useful in the event you have storage hardware of varying capabilities,
or if you have a mount requiring secrets to use, such as an AWS bucket.

This recipe is quite useful in conjunction with the 'backuphost' recipe.

If you want to setup a chroot-mount in the install_dir, use setup_chroot_mount in the script_dir within your application recipe.

You'll obviously want to have your application's recipe include the relevant FUSE driver (s3fs for the example above).

TODO: make this support more than 10 fusemounts at a time (csplit issue).

In the event that a pool is specified in a disk, specify the path relative to that pool.
Otherwise, use an absolute path to the file or device.

Optionally, you can specify a partition number in a disk, we use 1 by default.
