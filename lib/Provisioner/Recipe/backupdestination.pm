=head1 Provisioner::Recipe::backupdestination

=head2 SYNOPSIS

In recipes.yaml:

    somedomain:
        backupdestination:
            base_dir: /backup
            targets:
                database: "mysql"
                mail: "mail"
                ...
            hosts:
                - "some.domain.name"
            key_file: "path/to/private_key_in_the_datadir"

Would result in the rsync module 'database' being backed up to /backup/some.domain.name/mysql/$DAY, and so on for each target/domain.

=head2 DESCRIPTION

When you have files on the host which need backing up, but aren't already covered by the provisioning process itself.

Pair with a VM using L<Provisioner::Recipe::backup> to fully automate backups.

Backups are implemented via SSH authorized key read-only restricted execution of rsyncd as root.

Uses a backup and retention script for the configured host(s), backing up every day at midnight and pruning to 6mos every friday noon.

TODO: make retention period configurable, etc

Touches the file '/root/backup_in_progress' while running in case you want to use that to lock behaviors such as reboots to not disrupt backups.

Logs backup output to /var/log/backups/$HOST.log, and rotates the logs.

You'll probably want to use a separate disk mounted as the base_dir via L<Provisioner::Recipe::extradisk> to persist backups between deploys.
