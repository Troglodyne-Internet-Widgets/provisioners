PKGMGR=DPKG

#
# It is possible that a file, which is part of a package, may have been
# modified by the administrator. Typically this occurs for configuration
# files. However, the package manager may list the file as being modified.
# For the RPM package manager this may well depend on how the package was
# built. This option specifies a pathname which is to be exempt from the
# package manager verification process, and which will be treated
# as a non-packaged file. As such, the file properties are still checked.
#
# This option only takes effect if the PKGMGR option has been set, and
# is not 'NONE'.
#
# This option may be specified more than once.
#
# NOTE: Whenever this option is changed 'rkhunter --propupd' must be run.
#
# The default value is the null string.
#
#PKGMGR_NO_VRFY=""

# These options specify a command, directory or file pathname which will be
# included or excluded in the file properties checks.
#
# For the USER_FILEPROP_FILES_DIRS option, simple command names - for example,
# 'top' - and directory names are added to the internal list of directories to
# be searched for each of the command names in the command list. Additionally,
# full pathnames to files, which need not be commands, may be given. Any files
# or directories which are already part of the internal lists will be silently
# ignored from the configuration.
#
# For the USER_FILEPROP_FILES_DIRS option, wildcards are allowed, except for
# simple command names.
# For example, 'top*' cannot be given, but '/usr/bin/top*' is allowed.
#
# To extend the use of wildcards to include recursive checking of directories,
# see the GLOBSTAR configuration option.
#
# Specific files may be excluded by using the EXCLUDE_USER_FILEPROP_FILES_DIRS
# option. Wildcards may be used with this option.
#
# By combining these two options, and using wildcards, whole directories can be
# excluded. For example:
#
#     USER_FILEPROP_FILES_DIRS=/etc/*
#     USER_FILEPROP_FILES_DIRS=/etc/*/*
#     EXCLUDE_USER_FILEPROP_FILES_DIRS=/etc/rc?.d/*
#
# This will look for files in the first two directory levels of '/etc'. However,
# anything in '/etc/rc0.d', '/etc/rc1.d', '/etc/rc2.d' and so on, will be
# excluded.
#
# NOTE: Only files and directories which have been added by the user, and are
# not part of the internal lists, can be excluded. So, for example, it is not
# possible to exclude the 'ps' command by using '/bin/ps'. These will be
# silently ignored from the configuration.
#
# Both options can be specified more than once.
#
# NOTE: Whenever these options are changed 'rkhunter --propupd' must be run.
#
# The default value for both options is the null string.

#
# This option whitelists files and directories from existing, or not existing,
# on the system at the time of testing. This option is used when the
# configuration file options themselves are checked, and during the file
# properties check, the hidden files and directories checks, and the filesystem
# check of the '/dev' directory.
#
# This option may be specified more than once, and may use wildcards.
# Be aware though that this is probably not what you want to do as the
# wildcarding will be expanded after files have been deleted. As such
# deleted files won't be whitelisted if wildcarded.
#
# NOTE: The user must take into consideration how often the file will appear
# and disappear from the system in relation to how often rkhunter is run. If
# the file appears, and disappears, too often then rkhunter may not notice
# this. All it will see is that the file has changed. The inode number and DTM
# will certainly be different for each new file, and rkhunter will report this.
#
# The default value is the null string.
#
#EXISTWHITELIST=""

#

#
# If this option is set to '1', then the immutable-bit test is reversed. That

#
# The default value is '0'.
#
#IMMUTABLE_SET=0

#
# If this option is set to '1', then any changed inode value is ignored in

# Allow the specified process to use deleted files. The process name may be

# the given pathnames. For example:
#
#     ALLOWPROCDELFILE=/usr/libexec/gconfd-2:/tmp/abc:/var/tmp/xyz
#
# This option may be specified more than once. It may also use wildcards, but
# only in the deleted file pathnames, not in the process name. The use of
# extended pattern matching in pathname expansion (for example, '**') is not
# supported for this option. However, the option itself extends globbing when
# the '*' character is used by matching zero or more characters in the
# pathname, including those in sub-directories. For example, the pathname
# '/tmp/abc/def/xyz' would not be matched by shell globbing using '/tmp/*/xyz'
# but is matched when used in this option. Similarly, using '/tmp/*' will

PHALANX2_DIRTEST=1

#
# This option tells rkhunter where the inetd configuration file is located.

#INETD_CONF_PATH=/etc/inetd.conf

#
# This option allows the specified enabled inetd services.
#
# This is a space-separated list of service names. The option may be specified

#
# For non-Solaris users the simple service name should be used.
# For example:

# The default value is the null string.
#
#XINETD_CONF_PATH=/etc/xinetd.conf

#
# This option allows the specified enabled xinetd services. Whilst it would be

#
# The default value is the null string.
#
#XINETD_ALLOWED_SVC=/etc/xinetd.d/echo

#
# The default value is the null string.
#
#PWDLESS_ACCOUNTS=abc

ALLOW_SYSLOG_REMOTE_LOGGING=1

#
# This option allows the specified applications, or a specific version of an

# then the name must be followed by a colon and then the version number.
# For example:
#
#     APP_WHITELIST=openssl:0.9.7d gpg httpd:1.3.29
#
# This is a space-separated list of pathnames. The option may be specified

#APP_WHITELIST=""

# 
# Set this option to scan for suspicious files in directories which pose a

#
# Please do not enable the 'suspscan' test by default as it is CPU and I/O
# intensive, and prone to producing false positives. Do review all settings
# before usage. Also be aware that running 'suspscan' in combination with
# verbose logging on, rkhunter's default, will show all ignored files.
#
# Please consider adding all directories the user the (web)server runs as,
# and has write access to, including the document root (e.g: '/var/www') and
# log directories (e.g: '/var/log/httpd'). 
#
# This is a space-separated list of directory pathnames. The option may be
# specified more than once.
#
# The default value is the '/tmp' and '/var/tmp' directories.
#
#SUSPSCAN_DIRS=/tmp /var/tmp

#
# This option specifies the directory for temporary files used by the
# 'suspscan' test. A memory-based directory, such as a tempfs filesystem, is
# better (faster). Do not use a directory name that is listed in SUSPSCAN_DIRS
# as that is highly likely to cause false-positive results.
#
# The default value is '/dev/shm'.
#
#SUSPSCAN_TEMP=/dev/shm

#
# This option specifies the 'suspscan' test maximum filesize in bytes. Files
# larger than this will not be inspected. Do make sure you have enough space
# available in your temporary files directory.
#
# The default value is '1024000'.
#
#SUSPSCAN_MAXSIZE=1024000

#
# This option specifies the 'suspscan' test score threshold. Below this value
# no hits will be reported.
#
# The default value is '200'.
#
#SUSPSCAN_THRESH=200

#
# This option may be used to whitelist file pathnames from the suspscan test.
#
# Shell globbing may be used in the pathname. Also see the GLOBSTAR configuration
# option.
#
# This option may be specified more than once.
#
# The default value is the null string.
#
#SUSPSCAN_WHITELIST=""

#
# The following options can be used to whitelist network ports which are known
# to have been used by malware. 
#
# The PORT_WHITELIST option is a space-separated list of one or more of two
# types of whitelisting. These are:
#
#   1) a 'protocol:port' pair
#   2) an asterisk ('*')
#
# Only the UDP or TCP protocol may be specified, and the port number must be
# between 1 and 65535 inclusive.
#
# The asterisk can be used to indicate that any executable which rkhunter can
# locate as a command, is whitelisted. (Also see BINDIR)
#
# The PORT_PATH_WHITELIST option specifies one of two types of whitelisting.
# These are:
#
#   1) a pathname to an executable
#   2) a combined pathname, protocol and port
#
# As above, the protocol can only be TCP or UDP, and the port number must be
# between 1 and 65535 inclusive.
#
# Examples:
#
#     PORT_WHITELIST=TCP:2001 UDP:32011
#     PORT_PATH_WHITELIST=/usr/sbin/squid
#     PORT_PATH_WHITELIST=/usr/sbin/squid:TCP:3801
#
# NOTE: In order to whitelist a pathname, or use the asterisk option, the
# 'lsof' command must be present.
#
# Both options may be specified more than once.
#
# The default value for both options is the null string.
#
#PORT_WHITELIST=""
#PORT_PATH_WHITELIST=""

WARN_ON_OS_CHANGE=1

#
# Set the following option to '1' if you want rkhunter to automatically run a
# file properties update ('--propupd') if the O/S has changed. Detection of an
# O/S change occurs during the file properties check. Setting a value of '0'
# will cause rkhunter not to do an automatic update.
#
# WARNING: Only set this option if you are sure that the update will work
# correctly. That is, that the database directory is writeable, that a valid
# hash function is available, and so on. This can usually be checked simply by
# running 'rkhunter --propupd' at least once.
#
# The default value is '0'.
#
UPDT_ON_OS_CHANGE=1

#
# The following two options can be used to whitelist files and directories that
# would normally be flagged with a warning during the various rootkit and
# malware checks. Only existing files and directories can be specified, and
# these must be full pathnames not links.
#
# Additionally, the RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST option may include a string after the
# file name (separated by a colon). This will then only whitelist that string
# in that file (as part of the malware checks). For example:
#
#     RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST=/etc/rc.local:hdparm
#
# If the option list includes the filename on its own as well, then the file
# will be whitelisted from rootkit checks of the files existence, but still
# only the specific string within the file will be whitelisted. For example:
#
#     RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST=/etc/rc.local
#     RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST=/etc/rc.local:hdparm
#
# To whitelist a file from the existence checks, but not from the strings
# checks, then include the filename on its own and on its own but with just
# a colon appended. For example:
#
#     RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST=/etc/rc.local
#     RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST=/etc/rc.local:
#
# NOTE: It is recommended that if you whitelist any files, then you include
# those files in the file properties check. See the USER_FILEPROP_FILES_DIRS
# configuration option.
#
# Both of these options may be specified more than once.
#
# For both options the default value is the null string.
#
#RTKT_DIR_WHITELIST=""
#RTKT_FILE_WHITELIST=""

#
# The following option can be used to whitelist shared library files that would
# normally be flagged with a warning during the preloaded shared library check.
# These library pathnames usually exist in the '/etc/ld.so.preload' file or in
# the LD_PRELOAD environment variable.
#
# NOTE: It is recommended that if you whitelist any files, then you include
# those files in the file properties check. See the USER_FILEPROP_FILES_DIRS

#
# If this option is set to 'THOROUGH' then rkhunter will search (on a per
# rootkit basis) for filenames in all of the directories (as defined by the

# searches for only file names as opposed to file contents, this is one step
# away from the rigidity of searching in known (evidence) or default
# (installation) locations.
#
# THIS OPTION SHOULD NOT BE ENABLED BY DEFAULT.
#
# You should only activate this feature as part of a more thorough

#
# The following option can be set to the name(s) of the tests the 'unhide'

SHOW_SUMMARY_WARNINGS_NUMBER=1
SHOW_SUMMARY_TIME=3

#
# The two options below may be used to check if a file is missing or empty
# (that is, it has a size of zero). The EMPTY_LOGFILES option will also check
# if the file is missing, since that can be interpreted as a file of no size.
# However, the file will only be reported as missing if the MISSING_LOGFILES
# option hasn't already done this.
#
# Both options are space-separated lists of pathnames, and may be specified
# more than once.
#
# NOTE: Log files are usually 'rotated' by some mechanism. At that time it is
# perfectly possible for the file to be either missing or empty. As such these
# options may produce false-positive warnings when log files are rotated.
#
# For both options the default value is the null string.
#
#EMPTY_LOGFILES=""
#MISSING_LOGFILES=""

#
# This option can be set to either '0' or '1'. If set to '1' then the globbing
# characters '**' can be used to allow the recursive checking of directories.
# This can be useful, for example, with the USER_FILEPROP_FILES_DIRS option.
# For example:
#
#	USER_FILEPROP_FILES_DIRS=/etc/**/*.conf
#
# This will check all '.conf' files within the '/etc' directory, and any
# sub-directories (at any level). If GLOBSTAR is not set, then the shell will
# interpret '**' as '*' and only one level of sub-directories will be checked.
#
# NOTE: This option is only valid for those shells which support the 'globstar'
# option. Typically this will be 'bash' (version 4 and above) via the 'shopt' command,
# and 'ksh' via the 'set' command.
